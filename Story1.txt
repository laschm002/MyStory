My name is Luke, this is my story.  I live in Madison with my fiancee in an apartment on Park street.  
Currently, for the purpose of this course, I am staying with my parents in Fox Point.  I spent the past four years,
in graduate school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  I was in the Languages and Cultures of Asia Department.
I decided I didn't want to pursue the graduate program.
